                Quantum computers are a groundbreaking technology that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics
                to solve problems that are impossible or impractical for classical computers to handle.
                Their capabilities are expected to bring transformative changes across industries, including healthcare,
                cryptography, and artificial intelligence.

                Unlike classical computers that use bits as the basic unit of information, quantum computers use qubits.
                Qubits can exist in a state of superposition, enabling them to perform computations much faster and
                more efficiently than classical systems.

                With the potential to solve complex problems in seconds that would take classical computers millions of
                years, quantum computers are poised to revolutionize fields like drug discovery, financial modeling,
                and logistics optimization.
